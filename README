This is a toy tls-client-auth example.


Example usage:
-----------
./gen-certs.sh
./gradlew -q :server:run
./gradlew -q :client:run -P"ca-signed"
./gradlew -q :client:run -P"self-signed"


Gradle is cool. You only need java installed. The gradle wrapper (gradlew) will install gradle if it's not already installed.
